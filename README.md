The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a single-player game of rock paper scissors that pits you against
 the comupter. The computer's choices are randomly generated. A game lasts
 for 5 rounds.

 At the moment this project is strictly written in Javascript. I may revisit
 to add HTML & CSS at a future date.

2.20.23 - ADDING UI
 Adding a simple UI to this game that will include buttons for the player
 options and a running scoreboard.
